        <li><strong>Conclusion of sales and availability of stock</strong>
     <ol type="I">
        <li>Registered users may place orders for Goods, which sMugg or the Third Party Seller may accept or reject. Whether or not sMugg or the Third Party Seller accepts an order depends on the availability of Goods, correctness of the information relating to the Goods (including without limitation the price) and receipt of payment or payment authorization by sMugg for the Goods.</li>
        <li><u>NOTE: sMugg or the Third Party Seller will indicate the acceptance of your order by delivering the Goods to you or allowing you to collect them, and only at that point will an agreement of sale between you and sMugg or the Third Party Seller come into effect (the “Sale”).</u> This is regardless of any communication from sMugg stating that your order or payment has been confirmed. SMugg will indicate the rejection of your order (by sMugg itself or the Third Party Seller) by cancelling it and, as soon as possible thereafter, refunding you for any amount already paid<strong>.</strong></li>
        <li>Prior to delivery or your collection of the Goods, you may cancel an order at any time provided you do so before your order goes into ‘production status’.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that stock of all Goods on offer is limited and that pricing may change at any time without notice to you. In the case of Goods for sale by sMugg, sMugg will take all reasonable efforts to monitor stock levels and ensure that when stock is no longer available to update accordingly. However, we cannot guarantee the availability of stock. When Goods are no longer available after placing an order, sMugg will notify you and you will be entitled to a refund of the amount paid by you for such Goods or to choose another item of the same value.</li>
        <li>In the case of Goods for sale by a Third Party Seller, sMugg relies on inventory information supplied by the relevant Third Party Seller and sMugg accordingly bears no liability for any inaccuracies in the information supplied to it. Consequently, should you order any Goods from a Third Party Seller which are in fact sold-out, any resulting dispute should be resolved between you and the relevant Third Party Seller, your respective rights and obligations being as set out in these Terms and Conditions.</li>
